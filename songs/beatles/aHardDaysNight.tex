\subsection{A Hard Day's Night}

\\
It's been a [C]{hard} [F]{day's} [C]{night}, and I've been [Bb]{work}ing like a [C]{dog},
It's been a [C]{hard} [F]{day's} [C]{night}, I should be [Bb]{sleep}ing like a [C]{log},
But when I [F]{get} home to you, I find the [G7]{things} that you do, 
Will make me [C]{feel} [F]{al}[C]{right}.


You know I [C]{work} [F]{all} [C]{day}, to get you [Bb]{mon}ey, to buy you [C]{things},
And it's worth it just to [F]{hear} you [C]{say}, you're gonna [Bb]{give} me every[C]{thing},
So why on [F]{earth} should I moan, 'couse when I [G7]{get} you alone, 
You know I'll [C]{be} [F]{o}[C]{kay}.


When I'm [Em]{home},  [Am]{ev}erything seems to be [Em]{right};
When I'[C]{m} home, [Am]{fe}eling you holding [F]{me} tight,[G7]{ }tight, yeah.


It's been a [C]{hard} [F]{day's} [C]{night}, and I've been [Bb]{work}ing like a [C]{dog},
It's been a [C]{hard} [F]{day's} [C]{night}, I should be [Bb]{sleep}ing like a [C]{log},
But when I [F]{get} home to you, I find the [G7]{things} that you do,
Will make me [C]{feel} [F]{all} [C]{right},


You know I feel [F]{all} [C]{right},


You know I [C]{feel} [F]{all} [Bb]{right}      [C]{}
